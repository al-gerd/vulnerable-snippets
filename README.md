## **About** 
This repository contains some vulnerabilities examples, with a Bearer-based Github workflow in it that scans said vulnerabilities. This is a fork of the https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec-examples-vulnerabilities repository. No use or customization of Horusec tooling is made; the only changes concern the Github Workflows, this README and the addition of some mock vendored packages to facilitate CVE scanner tests.

As such, the LICENSE and copyright.txt remain unchanged.
